# iOS-Learning-Sessions
A repository of all files related to the iOS Learning Sessions taught by me for UMN App Developers Club - a student club at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. 

NOTE: I do NOT get paid to teach iOS App Development in these learning sessions but do it entirely for the benefit of the student community at UMN-TC and slightly my own in that I get to solidify my understanding and learning of any and all of these concepts. As they say, teaching is the best form of learning! 

1. Weeks 1 through 5:
   * Weeks 1 through 5 have been all about making our very first app: Bull's Eye. 
   * Week 5's folder contains all the relevant files for the same: Xcode Project, swift classes, storyboards, et al.
   * Credits for this game's content, code, and graphics go to iOS Apprentice by Matthis Hollemans.
